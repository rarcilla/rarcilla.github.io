Hi, I'm **Regina**, a fourth year undergrad studying Computer Science at the University of British Columbia, with an expected graduation date of November 2020.

After taking a seminar at school, I have taken a keen interest in mobile development and an excitement to explore all things related to the Swift language and it's ecosystem. _(Learning SwiftUI and Combine at the moment! 05/2020)_

Aside from programming, I also enjoy the design and research process behind creating meaningful user experiences.

When I'm not busy studying, I like spending time with my [dog](https://www.instagram.com/george_der_schnauzer/){:target="\_blank"}, learning new languages (I've taken intro to Mandarin, and currently taking German writing course!), and trying new brunch spots around Vancouver.

I am open to full-time job opportunities for Fall 2020. If you would like to chat, please feel free to [reach out!](mailto:regina.arcilla@alumni.ubc.ca)
