Hi, I'm **Regina**, a soon-to-be new graduate of the Bachelor of Computer Science program from the University of British Columbia.

After completing a few Human Computer Interaction and iOS Development courses at school, I have discovered my passion for creating things that people can enjoy. From researching and designing minuscule details of the UX/UI, to building out the application itself, I find it incredibly exciting to be involved in the different stages of product development.

When I'm not programming, I like spending time with my [dog](https://www.instagram.com/george_der_schnauzer/){:target="\_blank"}, learning foreign languages, and trying out new brunch spots around Vancouver.

I am open to full-time job opportunities by Fall 2020. If you would like to chat, please feel free to [reach out!](mailto:regina.arcilla@alumni.ubc.ca)
