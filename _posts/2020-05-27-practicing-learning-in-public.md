title: Practicing Learning in Public
description:
---

I've always enjoyed reading articles and blogs where people document their programming journey and learning experiences, but
the thought of writing my own had never crossed my mind, that is until I stumbled across a lengthy Twitter thread which linked to this article: ["Learn In Public" by Shawn Wang](https://www.swyx.io/writing/learn-in-public/).

I join the majority of people who classify as "private-learners" and "lurkers" whom Shawn mentions in his piece, in which I have my inherent shyness and introversion to thank.

Before long, I began to recall and see similar themes and messages reiterated:

In [Paul Hudson's short video for the 100 Days of SwiftUI challenge](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui), he underlined the importance of posting your progress to help solidify learning and build meaningful connections within the dev community.

A past instructor vouched for the welcoming nature of the iOS community when I had expressed my interest in becoming an iOS engineer post graduation and was looking for some direction.

The original Twitter thread author said it herself that blogging and posting in communities caused a positive feedback loop.

_The signs were practically in neon lights!_ **I needed to engage with others to learn effectively and productively.**

Since then, I've reached out to a couple of senior software engineers on Twitter with burning questions, both code and career related, and attended intimate [Swift workshops](https://www.tryswift.co/) to further immerse myself into iOS development. Small as they seem, I think that taking these first steps has lured me out of my comfort zone, if not, to the very edge of it. It only made sense that the next step was to start a blog (past-me could never!).

Here's to personal growth! ðŸŒ±
